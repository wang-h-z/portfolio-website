# codeforces megathread

wanted to start learning c++, in general i also really just enjoy leetcoding and was super inspired and interested by competitive programming concepts and the math/algos involved so naturally i wanted to start trying out some cp

resources that i'll be mainly interacting with: 
1. [competitive programming handbook](https://cses.fi/book/book.pdf)
2. [cp31 sheet](https://www.tle-eliminators.com/cp-sheet)
